    "# Bootstrapping - sampling within a sample\n",
    "- Problem : statistics about the data population are often unavailable, costly to acquire, unknown, etc.\n",
    "- Solution : utilize random sampling (and re-sampling) of available data to estimate population statistics\n",
    "    - The result of bootstrapping will be a distribution over sample statistics!\n",
    "    - Hopefully we'll see that these *sample statistics* $\\approx$ *population statistics*\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Bootstrapping basic procedure\n",
    "- Sample from the population\n",
    "- Re-sample from that same sample (make sure to have replace=True!)\n",
    "- Repeat\n",
    "- **Note** - after re-sampling, we will likely see duplicate data entries within a single sample, but that's okay! \n",
    "    - If we didn't have duplicates, then we would have the same exact data in every single sample (this would be bad!)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals\n",
    "- Goal : return a range of values that we are confident contain the true population statistic \n",
    "    - Bootstrapping gives us a distribution of sample statistics\n",
    "    - The true population statistic often lies within the bulk of that distribution \n",
    "- $X$% confidence interval \n",
    "    - Interpretation\n",
    "        - **YES**: $X$% of all bootstrapped sample statistics fall within that interval\n",
    "        - **YES**: ~$X$% of the time, the interval will capture the correct population statistic\n",
    "        - **YES**: I'm $X$% sure that the true population statistic is in the interval\n",
    "        - **NO**: the true population statistic has an $X$% change of being in the interval\n",
    "    - Computation\n",
    "        - Use $\\frac{100-X}{2}$ and $100-\\frac{100-X}{2}$ for lower and upper percentiles\n",
    "        \n",
    "### CIs for testing\n",
    "- Given P-value $p$ and null hypothesis \"population statistic = $a$\":\n",
    "    - Construct $(100-p)$ CI for populatiton statistic\n",
    "    - Reject null hypothesis if $a$ is not in the interval\n",
    "\n",
    "# Describing a Distribution : Mean and Spread\n",
    "- Center of a distribution \n",
    "    - *Mean* : balance point\n",
    "    - *Median* : half-way point (robust to outliers) \n",
    "- Spread of distribution \n",
    "    - *Range* : biggest - smallest\n",
    "    - *Standard deviation* : variability around the mean\n",
    "- Chebyshev's Inequality\n",
    "    - Proportion of values in the range \"average $\\pm\\ z$ SDs\" is â‰¥ $1-\\frac{1}{z^2}$\n",
    "- Looking forward\n",
    "    - We'll look at other types of distributions and ones that can be parameterized "
